    <h4>
      These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement made between
      you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you", "your") and Boston
      Children's Hospital ("BCH", "we", "our"), concerning your access to and use of
      Service Workbench. You agree to access and use Service Workbench for lawful
      purposes only. By accessing Service Workbench, you expressly consent to the
      monitoring of your actions, content, data transiting and storage therein.
    </h4>
    <h4>By accessing and using Service Workbench, you agree that you must:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Conduct only authorized business on the system.</li>
      <li>
        Maintain the confidentiality of your authentication credentials such as your
        password. Do not reveal your authentication credentials to anyone; an BCH,
        other Hospital, or university employee should never ask you to reveal them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow proper logon/logoff procedures. You must manually log on to your
        session; do not store your password locally on your system or utilize any
        automated logon capabilities. You must promptly log off when session access
        is no longer needed. If a log off function is unavailable, you must close
        your browser. Never leave your computer unattended while logged into the
        system.
      </li>
      <li>
        Access Service Workbench using only your own individual account. Group or
        shared accounts are NOT permitted. The credentials used for authenticating
        to Service Workbench must belong to a single individual. Your level of
        access to systems and networks owned by BCH is limited to ensure your access
        is no more than necessary to perform your legitimate tasks or assigned
        duties. If you believe you are being granted access that you should not
        have, you must immediately notify
        <a href="mailto:{CONTACT}" target="_blank">{CONTACT}</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Safeguard system resources against waste, loss, abuse, unauthorized use or
        disclosure, and misappropriation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Report all security incidents or suspected incidents (e.g., lost passwords,
        improper or suspicious acts) related to Service Workbench
        <a href="mailto:{CONTACT}" target="_blank">{CONTACT}</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Contact
        <a href="mailto:{CONTACT}" target="_blank">{CONTACT}</a>
        if you do not understand any of these rules.

    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If BCH provides links that are maintained or controlled by external
        organizations, the listing of links is not an endorsement of information,
        products, or services, and does not imply a direct association between the
        University and the operators of the outside resource links.
      </li>
      <li>
        Neither BCH nor its employees warrant that Service Workbench will be
        uninterrupted, problem-free, free of omissions, or error-free; nor do they
        make any warranty as to the results that may be obtained from Service
        Workbench. You expressly understand and agree that your use of Service
        Workbench, or any material available through it, is at your own risk.
      </li>
      <li>

        respective directors, officers, employees, faculty members or students be
        liable for any damages, include incidental, indirect, special, punitive,
        exemplary, or consequential damages, arising out of your use of or inability
